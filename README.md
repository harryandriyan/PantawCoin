## For Developers

### Release Process

PantawCoin uses GitHub Actions to automate the release process. Here's how to create a new release:

1. Make sure all your changes are committed and pushed to the main branch
2. Run the release script with the new version number:
   ```
   ./scripts/release.sh 1.0.1
   ```
3. Push the changes and the new tag:
   ```
   git push origin main
   git push origin v1.0.1
   ```
4. GitHub Actions will automatically:
   - Build the application
   - Create a macOS app bundle
   - Package it into a DMG file
   - Create a GitHub release with the DMG attached

The release will be available on the [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/PantawCoin/releases) page.

### Rate Limiting

The CoinGecko API has rate limits for free tier users. PantawCoin implements several strategies to handle this:

1. **Caching**: Data is cached for 5 minutes to reduce API calls
2. **Exponential Backoff**: When rate limited, the app will retry with increasing delays
3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: When API calls fail, the app will use cached data

If you're experiencing frequent rate limiting, consider:
- Getting a CoinGecko API key and adding it to the `apiKey` variable in `CryptoDataManager.swift`
- Increasing the refresh interval in `main.swift` (currently 5 minutes)
